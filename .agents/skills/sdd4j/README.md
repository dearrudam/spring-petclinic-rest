# SDD4J Skill

Drives Spec-Driven Development for Java using `package-info.java` as the co-located capability contract.

## When To Use

Use this skill for SDD4J setup, new capability specs, applying specs to code, verifying code against specs, EARS requirements, and traceable Java tests.

## Composition

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S[SDD4J workflow] --> W[setup / new / apply / verify]
  A[Architecture adapter] --> M[Capability-to-code mapping]
  T[Stack skill] --> V[Build, test, runtime verification]
  W --> C[Capability contract in package-info.java]
  M --> C
  V --> G[Green verification]
```

## Modes

```mermaid

  A["/sdd4j setup"] --> B[Declare project mapping in AGENTS.md]
  C["/sdd4j new capability"] --> D[Author package-info.java spec]
  E["/sdd4j apply capability"] --> F[Close spec-to-code and test gaps]
  G["/sdd4j verify capability"] --> H[Report conformance and drift]
```

## Spec Contract

An SDD4J capability spec defines:

- `## Boundary` transport-neutral operations.
- `## Requirements` EARS statements with stable ids such as `R1.1`.
- `## Entities` contract-relevant domain concepts when needed.
- `## Out of scope` explicit non-goals when needed.
- Optional `AGENTS.md` spec language for localized EARS prose.

## Core Rules

- The spec is the source of truth for intended behavior.
- One capability has one spec.
- Every requirement id must be grep-visible in at least one test.
- `new`, `apply`, and `verify` resolve `Spec language` from `AGENTS.md ## SDD4J`; when absent, specs are written and checked in English.
- EARS patterns are semantic and may be localized when configured.
- English requirements use `shall`; localized requirements use a consistent mandatory equivalent in the configured language.
- `apply` writes the correct implementation to pass new traceable tests.
- Code-to-spec drift is reported, not silently absorbed into the spec.
- Done means stack verification is green and no structural gap or drift remains.
